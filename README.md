# Landing-page
this project is a simple landing page from the odin project foundations course, where I have to 
put in practice all what I did learn in the previous lessons from css basics and html basics lessons like (flexbox, css fonts and colors...), in this project I've created a landing page for
a big energy drink brand called "PRIME", in the hero section I did give some information 
about the energy drink, then on the next section a list different flavors of the PRIME energy drink, then on the next section I did put a quote by logan paul the brand owner, then a CTA (Call To Action) section then finally a footer

## Tech Stacks
HTML(HyperText Markup Language) -> img, p, h1, div, strong, a, ul, li
CSS(Cascading Stylesheet) -> flexbox, box model, fonts, colors
